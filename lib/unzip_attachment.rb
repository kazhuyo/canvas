  # 3) extract the file into the unique filename
  # 4) attach the file to the context, in the appropriate folder, with a decent display name
  #
  # E.g.,
  # the zipfile has some_entry/some_file.txt
  # the context will have root_folder/some_entry added to its folder structure
  # the filesystem will get an empty file called something like:
  # /tmp/some_file.txt20091012-16997-383kbv-0
  # the contents of some_entry/some_file.txt in the zip file will be extracted to
  # /tmp/some_file.txt20091012-16997-383kbv-0
  # The context will get the contents of this file added to a new attachment called 'Some file.txt'
  # added to the root_folder/some_entry folder in the database
  # Tempfile will unlink its new file as soon as f is garbage collected.
